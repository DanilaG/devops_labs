# Best Practices For Git Actions CI

- Keep your actions minimal.
- Don’t install dependencies unnecessarily.
- Never hardcode secrets.
- Limit environment variables to the narrowest possible scope.
- Store authors in action metadata to promote code ownership.
- Don’t use self-hosted runners in a public repository.
- Don’t use uncertified actions.
